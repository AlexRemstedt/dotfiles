# ZSH

## Installation

To install _ZSH_ use the following commands

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

## Configuration

I like to use [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install). To install use:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" "" --keep-zshrc
```

This will keep the current `.zshrc`.
